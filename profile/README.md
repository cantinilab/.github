# Machine Learning for Integrative Genomics (ML4IG)

## Summary

We are a G5 research group led by Laura Cantini ([@laucan88](https://x.com/laucan88)) and located at the [Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/machine-learning-for-integrative-genomics/) (Paris, FR).

We work at the interphase of machine learning and genomics, developing methods exploiting the full richness and complementarity of the available single-cell data to derive actionable biological knowledge.
